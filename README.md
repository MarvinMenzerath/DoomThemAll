# DoomThemAll

DoomThemAll is a Minecraft (Bukkit) Mini-Game: Eliminate the other team using a Shotgun and Grenades!  
**Herzlich Willkommen, liebe "[Schlag den YouTuber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-twLkPWfVEcT)"-Zuschauer!**

## How To Play
After joining a match you see a countdown above your inventory and you are allowed to investigate the map.  
At the beginning you join the red or the blue team and get a blaze-rod (Shotgun) and an egg (Grenade). Both can be used with an right-click. While you can use the shotgun almost every time, you have to kill somebody from the other team to get a new grenade.
After one team reached 25 points the game is over.

## Setup
Follow these steps to setup and configure "DoomThemAll" on your server:

1. Download the plugin: Grab the current release from [here](https://github.com/MarvinMenzerath/DoomThemAll/releases) and put it in your plugins-folder.
2. Download Multiverse: Grab the current release from [here](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-core/) and put it in your plugins-folder.
3. Upload the maps: Upload the maps you want to play on and name them <code>dta-wX</code>, where "X" has to be a unique number. This will be the id of the arena. Example: <code>dta-w1</code>
This can be changed in the config-file (see <code>gameWorldPrefix</code>).
4. Now start your server and import the worlds. Example: <code>/mvimport dta-w1 normal</code>  After you did this for every arena, edit the Multiverse-world-config and change the following parameters (if you want to):
  * <code>allowweather: false</code>
  * <code>difficulty: PEACEFUL</code>
  * <code>animals:
      spawn: false</code>
  * <code>monsters:
      spawn: false</code>
  * <code>hunger: false</code>
5. Reload the Multiverse-Config: <code>/mvreload</code>
6. Set a DTA-Spawn: <code>/dta setlobby</code> You will spawn there if you type <code>/dta lobby</code>.
7. Configure the first arena:
  1. Teleport there: <code>/mvtp dta-w1</code>
  2. Now set every spawn (exactly 6!): Go to the place you want the players to spawn and type in <code>/dta setspawn [MAP] [SPAWN]</code>. Example: <code>/dta setspawn 1 1</code>
  3. Enable the arena: <code>/dta enable 1</code>.
  4. Place a sign to join the arena (every new line represents a line of the sign):
    1. <code>DoomThemAll</code>
    2. <code>__EMPTY__</code>
    3. <code>dta join [ARENA-ID]</code>
    4. <code>[MAP-NAME]</code>
